# FizzBuzz
Coding Exercise

Assumptions:
 - Exact matching of the sample input, sample output was required
 - variability in determining numeric entries (e.g. `2AFE`) was flexible
 - white space is expected to be invalid.
 - Divisions performed are only noted when noted superseded by a Fizz or Buzz event
